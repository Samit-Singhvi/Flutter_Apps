# Flutter Introduction

1. Flutter is a framework built over DART programming language, it have functions, widgets to control how the app looks.
2. Flutter considers everything on the APP screen as a widget, the whole app is a root widget consisting multiple nested widgets.
3. It works on a single-code base. We write code for the app in Flutter, and we can create both Android and iOS apps using the same code, without writing it for them individually.
4. Flutter comes with SDK(Software Development Kit), that does the compilation work for whichever platform we want our app to work.
5. It doesn't work like that - converting the code into native code for iOS and Android, like we add a button using Flutter, than converting the code line into corresponding code for adding button in iOS and Android. Instead Flutter itself control the appearance of the screen.
